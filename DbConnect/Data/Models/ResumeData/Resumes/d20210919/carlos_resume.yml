Brief: ''
AboutMe: Through living, studying and, working internationally, I have developed an expertise in language and culture. Considering where spoken languages intersect with data got me interested in programming.\n\r Software engineering is translating business requirements into solutions. I apply my advanced tech skills to analyses that consider where culture and computation converge. This, combined with my fluency for the most widely spoken languages, allows me to engineer unique solutions to diverse problems. \n\r I am eager to collaborate with highly motivated and experienced teams whose constant curiosity is tempered by a drive to produce excellent work.
