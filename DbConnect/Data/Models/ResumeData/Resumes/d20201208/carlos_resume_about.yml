aboutMe: "Through living, studying and working internationally,
  I have developed an expertise in language and culture. Considering where spoken languages
  intersect with data got me interested in programming.\\n\\r It can be said that software
  engineering is translating business requirements into solutions. I apply my advanced tech
  skills to analyses that consider where culture and computation converge. This, combined
  with my fluency for the most widely spoken languages, allows me to engineer unique
  solutions to diverse problems. \\n\\r I am eager to collaborate with highly motivated
  and experienced teams whose constant curiosity is tempered by a drive to produce excellent work."
