aboutMe: "Language Data Specialist. \\n\\r Through living, studying and working internationally,
  I have developed an expertise in language and culture. Considering where spoken languages
  intersect with data got me interested in programming. I apply
  my advanced tech skills to analyses that consider where culture and computation
  converge. This, combined with my fluency for the most widely spoken languages, allows
  me to engineer unique solutions to diverse problems."
