      <p class="mb-5">Showcasing the evolution of these skills has been a learning process on its own. 
        All of the work I have done since the bootcamp was internal corporate. This resume site is a work-in-progress to highlight some of those skills.  
        It is hosted on <a href="https://shortpoet.azurewebsites.net">Azure</a> with a linked database to dynamically populate the different resume formats.
        Please checkout the <a :href="pdfUrl">PDF-friendly</a> version below.  
        And coming soon, a guestbook that will fully illustrate the capabilites of a linked data source! ðŸ¤“</p>
