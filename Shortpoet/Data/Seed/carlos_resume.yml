aboutMe: Language Data Specialist - operate at the intersection of language and data. 
  Driven to analyze and provide insight from data on modes of speech as they reflect human behavior. 
  Through experience across hospitality, sales, and freelance language services, 
  I developed a varied and keen insight into human interaction, motivation, and the sheer nitty-gritty witnessed everywhere from hospitals to courthouses and union halls in between. 
  The call to bridge the gap between analogue expertise with long-dormant digital dexterity came in the form of my brother, freecodecamp, and finally formal training at 
  Washington University St. Louis Data Analytics Boot Camp, gaining essential tech skills - leveraging these for analysis of socio-economic trends across the spectrum of the 
  most widely spoken languages allows my clients a unique perspective on their field of choice.

  I have been known to be insipired by the dramatic muses.  Ask for an accent sometime!
  Being a big fan of perspective, when I started going underwater at age 11, what once was a world of fear turned into a world of wonder.  When I can,
  SCUBA is pretty sweet stuff.  Speaking of perspective, here's some shortpoetry...
